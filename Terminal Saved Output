Please note that these warnings are just used to help the Homebrew maintainers
with debugging if you file an issue. If everything you use Homebrew for is
working fine: please don't worry and just ignore them. Thanks!

Warning: You have uncommitted modifications to Homebrew
If this a surprise to you, then you should stash these modifications.
Stashing returns Homebrew to a pristine state but can be undone
should you later need to do so for some reason.
    cd /usr/local/Library && git stash && git clean -d -f

Warning: /usr/bin occurs before /usr/local/bin
This means that system-provided programs will be used instead of those
provided by Homebrew. The following tools exist at both paths:

    phar
    phar.phar
    php
    php-config
    phpize

Consider setting your PATH so that /usr/local/bin
occurs before /usr/bin. Here is a one-liner:
    echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile

A "/etc/my.cnf" from another install may interfere with a Homebrew-built
server starting up correctly.

To connect:
    mysql -uroot

To have launchd start mysql at login:
  ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/mysql/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
Then to load mysql now:
  launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mysql.plist
Or, if you don't want/need launchctl, you can just run:
  mysql.server start

To enable PHP in Apache add the following to httpd.conf and restart Apache:
    LoadModule php5_module    /usr/local/opt/php56/libexec/apache2/libphp5.so

The php.ini file can be found in:
    /usr/local/etc/php/5.6/php.ini

✩✩✩✩ Extensions ✩✩✩✩

If you are having issues with custom extension compiling, ensure that
you are using the brew version, by placing /usr/local/bin before /usr/sbin in your PATH:

      PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"

PHP56 Extensions will always be compiled against this PHP. Please install them
using --without-homebrew-php to enable compiling against system PHP.

✩✩✩✩ PHP CLI ✩✩✩✩

If you wish to swap the PHP you use on the command line, you should add the following to ~/.bashrc,
~/.zshrc, ~/.profile or your shell's equivalent configuration file:

      export PATH="$(brew --prefix homebrew/php/php56)/bin:$PATH"

✩✩✩✩ FPM ✩✩✩✩

To launch php-fpm on startup:
    mkdir -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents
    cp /usr/local/opt/php56/homebrew.mxcl.php56.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
    launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.php56.plist

The control script is located at /usr/local/opt/php56/sbin/php56-fpm

You may also need to edit the plist to use the correct "UserName".

Please note that the plist was called 'homebrew-php.josegonzalez.php56.plist' in old versions
of this formula.

To reload homebrew/php/php56 after an upgrade:
  launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.php56.plist

==> Caveats
To enable PHP in Apache add the following to httpd.conf and restart Apache:
    LoadModule php5_module    /usr/local/opt/php56/libexec/apache2/libphp5.so

The php.ini file can be found in:
    /usr/local/etc/php/5.6/php.ini

✩✩✩✩ Extensions ✩✩✩✩

If you are having issues with custom extension compiling, ensure that
you are using the brew version, by placing /usr/local/bin before /usr/sbin in your PATH:

      PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"

PHP56 Extensions will always be compiled against this PHP. Please install them
using --without-homebrew-php to enable compiling against system PHP.

✩✩✩✩ PHP CLI ✩✩✩✩

If you wish to swap the PHP you use on the command line, you should add the following to ~/.bashrc,
~/.zshrc, ~/.profile or your shell's equivalent configuration file:

      export PATH="$(brew --prefix homebrew/php/php56)/bin:$PATH"

✩✩✩✩ FPM ✩✩✩✩

To launch php-fpm on startup:
    mkdir -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents
    cp /usr/local/opt/php56/homebrew.mxcl.php56.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
    launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.php56.plist

The control script is located at /usr/local/opt/php56/sbin/php56-fpm

You may also need to edit the plist to use the correct "UserName".

Please note that the plist was called 'homebrew-php.josegonzalez.php56.plist' in old versions
of this formula.

To reload homebrew/php/php56 after an upgrade:
  launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.php56.plist
  launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.php56.plist
Spartica:jellibeans Mrinal$ sudo nano ~/.bash_profile
Spartica:jellibeans Mrinal$ sudo nano ~/.profile
Spartica:jellibeans Mrinal$ mkdir -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents
Spartica:jellibeans Mrinal$     cp /usr/local/opt/php56/homebrew.mxcl.php56.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
cp: /Users/Mrinal/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.php56.plist and /usr/local/opt/php56/homebrew.mxcl.php56.plist are identical (not copied).
Spartica:jellibeans Mrinal$     launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.php56.plist

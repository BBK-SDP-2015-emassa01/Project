\section*{Abstract}
\begin{justify}
This project report presents my research and the development of a prototype web application to assist users with Autism when they search the web. The system has modelled user interactions with the search process into a user profile for this category of users, integrating insights from the core features of autism into the model. The system is integrated with an infra-red, motion controlled, user interface component to assist users with Autism during search. The project provides insights into how search can be improved for users with Autism.\\

Autism & Autism is amongst the most common neuro-developmental condition and it is currently estimated that 1/68 children meet criteria for Autism Spectrum \cite{CDC}. Autism is five times more common amongst boys than girls (1/42 boys, and 1/189 girls). According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (2013), Autism is characterised by persistent and early deficits in reciprocal social interaction and repetitive behaviours. Individuals vary from high functioning to low functioning (along a spectrum), with behaviours emerging around 2 to 3 years of age.\\


Stereotyped User Model & Stereotyped user models infer characteristics about a user from data gathered from other users within that distinct subset. They can be built quickly using clusters of characteristics of groups of individuals.

This proect report presents my aim to research and develop a prototype web application for people with Autism when they search the web. Despite Autism being amongst the most common neuro-developmental condition (1/68 children meet criteria for Autism Spectrum \cite{CDC}), no user model has yet been developed for Autism within Search. 

\subsection {Background Research}\label{background} 

According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual \cite{CDC}, Autism is characterised by persistent and early deficits in reciprocal social interaction, so interaction with computers is prominent in this group. It is also well established that individuals with Autism are more engaged when using technology that is receptive and interactive (e.g., games, responsive consoles, motion controlled devices) compared to technology that is not \cite{motioncontrollerforautism}. This project will combine interactive, motion recognition hardware with search to also improve the UI (user interface) of search for individuals with Autism.\\

\vspace{5mm}
Research has shown that people with Autism are less context-sensitive and prefer a more detail-focused processing style \cite{mottron}. There is good reason to postulate then, that web-search queries are formed very differently to the typical population. Generally speaking, individuals with Autism prefer, and are more likely to engage in an item-specific, or detailed processing style, resulting in web-search queries that are more likely formed of single-order associations. In addition to a detailed, item-specific processing style, individuals with Autism are also less likely to engage in a contextual processing style. For example in a search for `Guitar', a contextual style of processing would imply an awareness that the word is related to `Piano', but also that both words are hierarchically related to `Instrument'. In day to day life, a major factor determining the effectiveness of working-memory (the transient holding and processing of information for updating, learning and comprehension), and the amount and quality of information that an individual can recall and enter into the web-search, is greatly influenced by the number of cues that are available at the time. For example, if presented with a list of 50 items to remember, you are more likely to remember that I presented `Zebra' if I tell you that I presented an animal. This type of `cued' recall can be used to bolster recall of information, and is a technique that will be applied in the current project to enable individuals with Autism to formulate better search queries in their browser. \\

\subsection{The Problems with Current Web-Search}\label{What should search offer people with Autism}

The Internet is one of the largest resources of information. Search engines allow users to collate hundreds of links on a single topic, using only a few words or phrases. The typical user sorts the returned results into `relevant' or `irrelevant' categories, flexibly shifting (mentally) between one result and the next, to determine the relevance of each page returned by the search engine. Search allows the user to assimilate the information on the page into their knowledge and is an important learning tool. For people with Autism, the requirement is no different, however, current search is not adequate. A large body of research has shown that `mental shifts' are a known area of weakness for people with Autism \cite{disengagement}. The information is therefore harder to assimilate or learn, and judging the relevance of each document becomes near impossible. One successful Psychological technique to increase the assimilation of information for individuals with Autism is to present it in clearer, smaller amounts \cite{AdultsWithAutism}. This technique avoids overwhelming individuals, and although less information is presented as a whole, whatever is presented to the user becomes `digestible' and ultimately, the information as a whole becomes more understandable.  \\
\vspace{5mm}
One of the first aims of the current project was to build a synthesis of three leading search engines, to ensure the best possible results were retrieved and presented to the user. The first stage was to therefore build the combination search engine and test the results on a user group with Autism. The goal of the research was to understand if the synthesis of the search engines enhanced search experience (in other words were users happy with the combination search), or, whether the results introduced redundancies or oddities in the results (some users may not use a certain search engine because they do not find the results helpful).\\
\vspace{5mm}

Search queries usually fall into one of three broad categories \cite{seo}.  `Do' queries which characterise transactions between the user and the search engine, for example when the user wants to do something such as \textit{buy a plane ticket}, \textit{listen to a song} or, \textit{download a screensaver}. `Know' type queries, which are informational in nature, usually covering a broad topic, for example, the \textit{name of a band} or \textit{restaurant in London}, \textit{trucks}, or \textit{Colorado}. The third broad category is `Go' type queries, which are navigational in nature, for example, searching for a particular home page on the web, \textit{YouTube} or \textit{American Airlines}. There are also many stages to the search process \cite{seo}. After identifying the information need, the user must formulate a search query. The user must browse through results once the query has been entered into a search engine. The whole process can be repeated if the user is not satisfied. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item{Experience the need for an answer,
solution, or piece of information.}
\item{Formulate that need in a string of words and phrases, also known as `the query'.}
\item{Enter the query into a search engine.}
\item{Browse through the results for a match.}
\item{Click on a result}
\item{Scan for a solution, or a link to that solution.}
\item{If unsatisfied, return to the search results and browse for another link or ...}
\item{Perform a new search with refinements to the query}
\label{search flows}
\end {enumerate}

\subsection{Current Project}
This project report presents a prototype browser-based application to assist users with Autism when they search the web. The application is hereafter referred to as Jellibeans\footnote{Jellibeans are a rainbow of colours, different sizes and shades, and the name represents the difference in style of processing of individuals with ASD.}. Jellibeans utilises gesture and hand movement data recorded using the Leap Motion Controller (LEAP) to enable an interactive search in the web browser. 

\vspace{5mm}
In programmatic terms, Jellibeans is 

ed to implement a research-guided user model in search. The developer for the current project has extensive research experience from working with individuals with Autism, and will apply these insights into the development of the Jellibeans. The development of this user model consisted of iterations of the `research, development, test, evaluate' lifecycle. I conducted research surveys to identify differences in user queries and analysed search behaviour patterns from people with and without Autism. Using these data I built a set of features into search, to guide the user through forming a more complete search query. Development and evaluation included the implementation and testing of the features, and further implementation and revision of the software to enhance the search process and the precision of the search engine for the users' intended search query. 

\vspace{5mm}
Jellibeans integrates a motion controlled user interface (UI) using the LEAP motion controller. The interface is very dynamic as opposed to static, which can hold users' attention for long periods of time. In the past, users with Autism have struggled to maintain their attention to sift through the large number of search results. In line with the attention difficulties individuals with Autism face, Jellibeans has been designed to reduce the amount of text on the search results page, presenting only 3 results per page, instead of the default 10. 

\subsection{Parametric Search Design for Web Applications}

Search engines like Google apply strong reduction techniques to navigation of the web. For example, one common way this reduction pattern is implemented is by assuming the behaviour of the current user is similar to the behaviour of other users in similar situations. This is often seen in recommendation engines, e.g., Amazon. The principle applied by Google is to `make it easy' for the user \cite{googleTerms}, by assuming that users form search queries similarly, and returning similar results to those users.

\vspace{5mm}
As we have seen in the introduction, users with Autism behave in different ways to typical users when navigating search. Users with Autism do not use the same key phrases when looking for documents with several attributes, i.e., queries that would be best formulated using several iterations of search, or multiple search parameters. This leads to an ineffective search; one that requires users to sift through results which are in large-part irrelevant, and a bad user experience.  

\vspace{5mm}
Parametric search queries allow users to specify parameters for their search in an increasingly logical and structured way. As an example, consider the experience of searching for flights to a particular holiday destination. This requires high cognitive `load' (remembering and manipulating arrival, departure, destination, timings, airlines, seat preferences etc.) so searches are often structured using fixed options (see Figure~\ref{exped}).

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.27]{expedia}
\caption{Expedia Parametric Search Example}
\label{exped}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

For typical users, parametric search is more structured, and in some circumstances seems more natural than a free keyword search. It makes search queries easier to formulate in situations where there is a high cognitive load.  We can apply this idea to web search for people with Autism, by asking them to enter criteria that can be applied to subgroups of search queries. Parametric search can assist the user with capturing the search parameters that are useful for a query it does not ultimately reduce the number of search results returned; the possibility of a large result set is most definitely true. So, although this tackles one aim of Jellibeans, further refinement of the search results would also be necessary.

\subsection{Motion controllers}
Individuals with Autism have poor attention \cite{attention}. The static 2-dimensional interface of many current search engines is unlikely to maintain adequate (sustained) interest levels. Individuals (and especially teenagers) with Autism spend a substantial amount of their time using computers, web, portable or console devices \cite{Shane and Albert}, as they find these more stimulating and attention-grabbing. For these individuals, computer-based technologies provide a stable, consistent learning environment that can be customized \cite{moore}. Furthermore, motion recognition devices can be programmed to make consistent responses to environmental triggers. These controlled and interactive environments have shown promise for improving social communication skills and reducing repetitive behaviours \cite{gameshealth}. For the current project a motion-controlled learning environment will be bolstered to improve attention within search for people with autism. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.47]{vision}
\caption{UI component for the project \cite{leap}.}
\label{vision}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection {Aims for Jellibeans}
Jellibeans is a prototype search tool that assists users with Autism search and navigate the web. As search can be compartmentalised into `Do', `Know' and `Go' type queries, it provides a natural way to tackle the issue of simplifying the search process for people with Autism. Users first identify the type of search they would like to carry out. Then Jellibeans better phrases a question to guide the user through their informational demand. Each stage of the search flow process (see Section~\ref{search flows}), is better tailored towards providing a concrete and unambiguous experience for the user with Autism, and reducing the amount of text on the page. 

\vspace{5mm}
When using Jellibeans, users are assisted through the process of formulating a search query (much like a parametric search engine form for example when you buy a car, you fill out many criteria which must be simultaneously searched for). Concretely phrased questions are aided by suggestions that appear laterally on the page.

\vspace{5mm}
The user can add these suggestions into their search query without the need to type them in, just by using natural hand movements, tracked by the LEAP motion controller. The UI component makes the experience of searching the web more interactive and receptive for user input. The suggestions also serve as cues for the user, and to simplify the search process for them. 

\vspace{5mm}
The implementation of a parametric-like search means the process of forming a query is more tightly defined and predictable for the user compared to the current systems for web search. The size of the result-set is also reduced, and adapted towards users with Autism.   

\vspace{5mm}
Each of these features were tested on a group of users with Autism\footnote{Autism diagnostic status was determined using the Autism Quotient, which strictly speaking is not a diagnostic assessment tool. However the measure has a 79\% sensitivity to Autism if the user scores above 32 on the measure.}. The final product will be integrated in the web browser and within a motion-controlled environment. The prototype will be modified accordingly in line with the outcome of several stages of user research.\\ The core features of Jellibeans are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item {A web-based search tool, that uses a \textit{stereotyped}\footnote{Stereotyped user models infer characteristics about a user from data gathered from other users within that distinct subset.} user model of Autism to filter search results. The features of the model were determined following analyses of survey responses gathered from individuals with Autism or a high occurrence of autism-like symptoms. The survey was administered online using a web-based survey engine \cite{surveymonkey}, and focused on identifying the differences in user search query generation for people with autism. The user model for Jellibeans also takes into account the user's demographic data and other group-wide characteristics have been inferred from the Autism subset of users.}

\item {Jellibeans implements a parametric-like search to present search results in the context in which they were searched. Jellibeans returns small snippets on the results page (the result page is not verbally-overloaded).}

\item {Jellibeans prioritises results which have first-order semantic relations to the query words. Jellibeans employs a boolean `AND' between each query word searched for, so that results are more likely first order semantic relations to the searched query.}

\item {Jellibeans implements within a motion controlled UI which uses the LEAP controller. This makes search more interactive and receptive for users. The LEAP also works to maintain the attention of the user.}

\item  {A prior iteration of Jellibeans implemented a combination search web application that synthesised the results from three of the largest and most popular engines; Google, Bing and Yahoo \cite{adam}. The development and testing of the feature is presented in the current report, as it demonstrates how Jellibeans has evolved after gathering user feedback.} 
\end{enumerate}


\section{Project Specification and Design} 

The following requirements were proposed for Jellibeans web application. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.65]{JellibeanUserFlow.png}
\end{center}
\caption{Wireframe Sketches for Jellibeans User Flow. A prototype version of Jellibeans using static html pages can be found at http://esha.mseth.co. A dynamic and near-production version of Jellibeans using routes rather than static html, which is fully LEAP motion controller-enabled can be found at jellibeans.mseth.co. }
\label{JBeanUserFlow}
\end{figure}

\vspace{5mm}
Jellibeans implemented a combination search web application that synthesised the results from three of the largest and most popular engines; Google, Bing and Yahoo \cite{adam}.

\vspace{5mm}

Jellibeans integrates with Google+, to allow the user to sign in and have their profile picture and name displayed, enhancing the feel of a personalised search engine (see Figure~\ref{googlesignin}).

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{helloEsha}
\end{center}
\caption{Using the Google+ API Allowed the User to Sign In and Retrieve User Name and Profile Picture.}
\label{googlesignin}
\end{figure}

Jellibeans employs a parametric-like search, including \textit{suggestions} to guide the user towards forming succinct and accurate search queries (see Figure~\ref{JBeanUserFlow}). Once signed in, the user can fill out the Autism Quotient and get feedback regarding their autism symptomology. The Autism Quotient \cite{Baron Cohen et al} is a Psychological assessment and validated screening tool for autism spectrum disorders. Users can also save their responses for each question to a local file for their reference.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{SocialPage}
\end{center}
\caption{An example page from Jellibeans: the Social Query page.}
\label{SocialPage}
\end{figure}


Jellibeans web application is integrated with a motion controlled UI, the LEAP controller (see Figure~\ref{UserMakingQuery}) giving the application a receptive and interactive user interface.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.15]{UserMakingQuery}
\caption{User Forming A Jellibean Search Query with LEAP Using Both Hands.}
\label{UserMakingQuery}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Jellibeans prioritises and displays the three highest precision search results for users. Recall of the search engine is sacrificed in line with the demands of the user model, to have less textual information on the page.

\vspace{5mm}
Jellibeans reduces the amount of text on the webpage by having results display on a modal (a hovering display panel on the page) which can be easily closed, and reopened to display results (see Figure~\ref{resultsModal}). Due to the nature of parametric search, strict boolean operators used in Jellibeans, and the reduced number of search results displayed, the results from Jellibeans are a direct semantic relation to the search query. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{ResultsModal}
\end{center}
\caption{Top 3 results are presented back to users in a modal to reduce information on the page. The modal can easily be closed and reopened.}
\label{resultsModal}
\end{figure}

\section{Product Specification}
The Functional Requirements of Jellibeans are: 

\begin{itemize}
\item{Java Applet for the Combination Search Engine (Java).}
\item{Rendering the Application to the Web Browser (HTML, CSS, BootStrap, php).}
\subitem{Integration with Google+ API (JavaScript and JQuery).}
\subitem{Integration with Google Custom Search API (JavaScript).}
\item{LEAP Motion Controller (LEAP SDK and LeapStrap).}

\end{itemize}

\end{comment}

\section{System and Software Architecture}

\subsection{Architecture of the System: 3-tier Architecture}
A client-server software architecture was used for Jellibeans. The user interface and motion controller formed the presentation layer, the logic layer was made up of the JavaScript code used to implement the custom search, and storage of data in the data store were maintained as three distinct modules. The advantages of this type of design is that it allows each of the tiers to be modified, upgraded or replaced independently of one another. For example, if Jellibeans were to be implemented with another motion controller (e.g. the Oculus VR Rift), it would only impact the Presentation tier (see Figure~\ref{ntier}).
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.65]{ntier}
\caption{3-tier architecture implementation}
\label{ntier}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

To see a list of the API's, development languages used and their justifications, see Appendix~\ref{implementation}. The APIs and languages are listed in the context they were used below.\\

\vspace{5mm}

\begin{itemize}
\item{Presentation Module\\
The presentation module consists of:}

\subitem{Jellibean Web Application: Rendering the web application to the browser (HTML, CSS and Bootstrap).}

\subitem{Rendering a Parametric-Like Search in the browser: The user is asked specific questions to break down their search query into smaller manageable terms, i.e., into `Do', `Know', `Go', or `Social' queries, and then into direct search terms. This reduces the ambiguity individuals with Autism face when forming a search query. The web application provides suggestions or cues for users. Once the search terms are entered by the user, they are sent to the logic module to form the search query string, and then onto the data store to retrieve the results which are subsequently rendered onto the screen for the user (HTML, CSS, php and Bootstrap).}

\subitem{Google+ Integration: Jellibeans integrates with Google+ API to retrive and render user profile data. This enhances the feel of a personalised search engine. Once signed in, users complete a diagnostic assessment of Autism (the Autism Quotient \cite{Baron Cohen et al}). The user's entries are sent to the logic module to be calculated. A user can also save a copy of their diagnostic information to a local file on their computer (JQuery, JavaScript and Google+ API).}

\subitem{LEAP UI Component: Jellibeans is a LEAP enabled website, and has a Motion Controlled UI in the web browser. The motion controller provides an interactive search experience, and maintains the user's full attention during search (LEAP SDK and LeapStrap).}

\item{Logic Module\\
At the logic layer, Jellibeans works to build user search queries from the elements on the web page. The parameters are entered by the user when they form their search query at the presentation layer. The Builder Design pattern was used to build a complete search query, and submit these to the Data Store so that the result pages could be returned to the user. \\
The logic module enables:}

\subitem{Logic to produce a combination search engine that synthesises the search results from Google, Bing and Yahoo. The aim of this feature is to increase recall of the search engine (Java).}

\subitem{Logic to integrate with the Google+ API (JavaScript and Google+ API).}

\subitem{Calculation of the users' AQ Score using the questionnaire entries that are entered at the presentation layer. The score is returned to the presentation layer after calculation (JavaScript).}

\subitem{Logic to formulate the user's search query, given their entries at the presentation layer (JavaScript).}

\subitem{Logic to send the query to the Google Data Store, and, to retrieve the search results to render them to the presentation layer (JavaScript and Google Custom Search API).}

\subitem{Logic to prioritise the three highest ranking search results and to reduce the text and verbal information on the page (in line with the aims of Jellibean Search), (JavaScript and Google Custom Search API).} 

\subitem{The logic layer communicates with the Google Data Store layer to retrieve the search results for the user.}

\item{Data Store Module}

\subitem{Jellibeans works with the Google Custom Search engin to retrieve the (indexed) documents from the Google data store. The documents that are retrieved match the participants' search query string after processing at the logic module level. }
\end{itemize}

\section{Software Design Pattern}
I will now describe the design pattern that guided the software development process. Jellibeans uses the model-view-controller (MVC) software design pattern. There are three components to the MVC pattern (see Figure ~\ref{laravelMVC}). 

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{laravelMVC}
\end{center}
\caption{Application Model-View-Controller pattern as described by \cite{laravel}.}
\label{laravelMVC}
\end{figure}

For Jellibeans this results in the following components and classes:

\begin{itemize}
\item{The \textbf{Model}- is the domain or real world entity that the software is built around. The model in this case is the User.}
\item{The \textbf{View}- is the visual representation of the user, given a context. So, in this case it is the resulting markup that the php framework (Laravel) renders to the users browser (i.e., the html code). The view generates the user interface, and is accessible via the user(model). The view doesn't handle the data that comes in (although users input the data into the view that is presented). There are 6 views of the system.}
\subitem{\tab{index.php renders the homepage}}
\subitem{\tab{search.php renders the Search screen}}
\subitem{\tab{do.php renders the Do search page}}
\subitem{\tab{know.php renders the Know search page}}
\subitem{\tab{go.php renders the Go search page}}
\subitem{\tab{social.php renders the Social search page}}
\subitem{\tab{result.php renders the Results page}}
\item{The \textbf{Controller}- Coordinators provide links between the view and the model. Coordinators are responsible for input-processing and determining the behaviour of Jellibeans, such as rendering a new screen. Controller.php is an abstract class that all other controllers extend see Figure~\ref{controller}. Jellibeans has the following Controllers:}
\subitem{PagesController.php controls the page behaviour when a user clicks on the navigation buttons, for example, return the user back to the homepage.}
\subitem{RegistrationController.php controls the model's storing and registering of the user and user credentials.}
\subitem{SearchController.php controls the behaviour of which search to carry out given the view.}
\subitem{SessionsController.php controls the behaviour of the view depending on whether the user is logged in or logged out. For example, if the user is logged out it will display the register and login buttons on the html page. If the user is logged in, it will return the logout button. It also }
\subitem{UserController.php verifies the CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) actions form the resource.}
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.55]{controllers}

 to the JavaScript methods in the relevant class (dependent upon the user's search behaviours), parsed into the correct format, before a POST request is then made to the Jellibeans Custom Search Engine to process the request.
\item{Chain of responsibility Pattern.}\\
Because there are many behaviours that the user can perform before their query string is formulated and ready to be posted to the search engine, the software also makes use of the Chain of responsibility pattern where at each stage the user's query is passed along a chain, with added functionality and methods depending on what the behaviour of the user was.
\item{Adapter Pattern.}\\
I accessed the user's Google+ profile data (name and profile picture) and presented these on the Jellibeans homepage. I then used the Adapter design pattern to build my own functionality onto the existing profile. For example, to present the user's Autism Quotient score, and to guide the user through forming their search query. 

The software design patterns that were chosen to implement the logic layer, and software architecture (3 tier) to implement Jellibeans work together to reduce coupling between the interface (web browswer and motion controller), logic (classes and the query), and data store layers.

\section{Implementation}
The prototype version of Jellibeans is hosted at esha.mseth.co. This prototype was used for user testing, to quickly and cheaply develop and test the system. The prototype version of Jellibeans used static web pages which allowed the prototype to be quickly tested and finalised.

Jellibeans was finalised into a dynamic website and is hosted at jellibeans.mseth.so. The advantages of a dynamic website are that it is much more functional, no need to edit individual html pages, and no code repetition. 

\vspace{5mm}
The next section of the report describes how each module of work was completed.

\subsection{Combination Search Engine: Google, Yahoo and Bing.} 
To implement the combination search engine I used three API's provided by Google, Bing and Yahoo, namely, the Google Custom Search API, Yahoo BOSS Java API and Bing Search API. 

\vspace{5mm}
To get started with the Google Custom Search API, I created a project called \textit{Jellibeans} in the Google Developers Console, and an OAuth 2.0 Client ID. I obtained a Consumer Key and Secret to use the API, and used these in the application code to access the Google Custom Search Engine (see Figure~\ref{JBeanAppletGoogleCustomSearch1}). 

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{JBeanAppletGoogleCustomSearch}
\end{center}

\caption{Jellibean Applet Combination Search Engine}
\label{JBeanAppletGoogleCustomSearch1}
\end{figure}

Following that I also registered my JavaScript origins within the console to access the Google+ API, and redirected URIs so that once users Sign-In using their Google+ login credentials they will be redirected to Jellibeans (or http://esha.mseth.co). This was done because I wanted users to be able to sign in and access their google profile from Jellibeans (see Figure~\ref{GoogleSignInPage}), giving the user the feel of a more personalised search experience. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.65]{aboutme}
\end{center}
\caption{Google+ Integration Code and Sign In Pop-Up.}
\label{GoogleSignInPage}
\end{figure}

Following a similar protocol for Yahoo and Bing Search API's, I created projects in the Yahoo Developers Network, and Microsoft Azure Marketplace, and purchased an API Consumer Keys and Secrets (for use with the APIs). 

\subsubsection{Web Scraping}
As Bing and Yahoo Search API's were not opensource, I explored the efficacy of web scraping using the JSoup API. With the JSoup API I was able to retrieve the search results in line with the goal for the first aim of project, using a different href filter for each search engine. Web-Scraping is however, against Google policies (see section 5.3 of Appendix~\ref{GoogleToS1} for Google Terms of Service). 

\vspace{5mm}
I used the Jsoup API \cite{jsoup}, which is a Java-written API for HTML. The library provides methods to conveniently extract data using the DOM (Data Object Model) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) methods. 

\vspace{5mm}
The combined Google, Yahoo and Bing results were integrated these into a Java Applet that runs in Eclipse Luna IDE (see Figure~\ref{AppletFig}). The program ran so that the user could enter a search query and the results would be presneted back to them for inspection. The top 10 links, from each search engine were presented to users. Results were ranked prior to presentation, such that result 1 from Google was followed by result 1 from Yahoo, and that was followed by result 1 from Bing. Then results 2 from Google, Yahoo and Bing were presented and so on, until the 30 links were produced (top 10 links for a search from each search engine), in ranked order from the three search engines.

\subsection{Building a User Model of Autism.}
To identify the features of the user model to build, I ran a study to collect example search queries on a set of informational needs from 37 participants. The participants were asked to give examples of search queries they would use to, for example, identify the name of a song they had heard (given the lyrics), or the name of a breed of a dog they had seen (given a picture of the dog). There were in total 10 search queries; the study was distributed widely via Surveymonkey.com \cite{surveymonkey} and can be seen in the Appendix ~\ref{AppendixA}. All participants were also asked to complete the Autism Spectrum Quotient 50-item questionnaire see Appendix ~\ref{AQ}. The participants responses are analysed and reported back to surveymonkey.


\vspace{5mm}
Participants were divided into two groups; low AQ scorers (scores below 30), and high AQ scorers (scores equal to and above 30). There were 30 low AQ scorers and 7 high AQ scorers. 


\subsubsection{Differences in Search Queries Between Users With and Without Autistic-like traits.}
I conducted a qualitative analysis on the search query strings from both low and high AQ scorers.

\vspace{5mm}
To confirm the results from the user testing of Core Feature 1, participants were asked to indicate which search engine they commonly use, and in both groups, Google was the prefered search engine by far, with all participants reporting that they used Google as a first choice. No one in the current sample used Yahoo or Bing.

\vspace{5mm} 
The low AQ scorer responses were analysed together to establish a baseline answer. This was generated using a frequency criterion of 40\% i.e., if 12 out of 30 respondents or more generated the same portion of a query string given an informational need, it was included in the model below. If two responses were equally as common, both are reported in the model. Data was discarded when a response indicated that the participant would do an image search, as this was not the aim of the survey. The results from the frequency analysis are presented below.

\begin{enumerate}
\item{You hear a song on the radio with the lyrics, `Look at your children', and you want to download it. What would you type into search on your favourite search engine to find out what song it was?\\\textit{Look at your children song}. \\\textit{Look at your children lyrics}.}
\item{You've lost touch with an old school friend (you went to St. Mary's School). What key words/queries would you use to find them?\\\textit{St. Mary's School Year of X}.}
\item{How would you identify what this is using a search engine (pretend you don't know what it is called). What key words/queries would you use?\\\textit{Star shaped brown plant}.}
\item{How would you find out the name of this famous person using a search engine? What key words/queries would you use?\\\textit{Brown hair famous young women}.}
\item{How would you identify what breed this animal is using a search engine? What key words/queries would you use?\\\textit{Small dog fluffy breed}.}
\item{Your friend and you can't agree on how Thandie Newton pronounces her first name. How would you resolve this using a search engine?\\\textit{Thandie Newton pronunciation}.}
\item{What would you search for to identify this pattern's name, and which country it originates from?\\\textit{Repeating square maze pattern border}.}
\item{How would you search for delay's relating to your (imminent) flight to Paris?\\\textit{Flight number, carrier, Paris, airport, flight time}.}
\end{enumerate}

There was a lot more variation in the responses gathered from the group with Autistic-like traits. The responses can be seen in Appendix~\ref{asdresponses}. The following observations were made for the users in the high AQ group:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{There were an increased number of incompletely-formed queries. In the high AQ group, participants were more likely to miss off words in the query string. For example, when analysing the results from query 1 above, 2 out of 7 respondents in the high AQ group did not put `lyrics' or `song' in the search query when searching for the lyrics ``Look at your children". When these search strings are entered into Google, the results are very different (see Figure~\ref{someresults}). A larger number of results are returned to the incomplete query (302,000,000 compared to 32,900,000). In this instance, the high AQ user group were presented with results that have a lower precision, i.e., more irrelevant information that they must sift through to find the answer to their search query.}
\label{incomplete}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\begin{subfigure}{.5\textwidth}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.7\linewidth]{lookAtUrChildren}
  \caption{Incomplete query results.}
\end{subfigure}%
\begin{subfigure}{.5\textwidth}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.7\linewidth]{lookAtUrChildrenLyrics}
  \caption{Complete query results.}
\end{subfigure}
\caption{High and low AQ scorers both formed search queries accurately, however there was an increased tendency to omit the word ``lyrics" in the high AQ group resulting in very different search results.}
\label{someresults}
\end{figure}

\item{Although many high AQ scorers' formed query strings well, there was increased use of idiosyncratic words in the query strings that were formulated. This is in line with previous research that suggests that people with autism organise information in more subjective and individual ways \cite{subjective organisation}. For example, referring to the picture of the dog as `yorkie pooh'(not listed in frequency index), `aeroplane' (frequency of 8254 words per million) instead of plane (frequency of 33900 words per million) or flight (29535 words per million) , `miniature' (less than 4973 words per million) instead of small (185463 words per million). The idiosyncratic nature of the words is captured by their lower frequency of use in the English language. Search engines use term frequency to determine if a document is relevant to the users search query. If the frequency of words used to form search queries differs between low and high AQ scorers, so will the rankings of the returned search results.}
\label{idiosyncrasy}


\item{One individual of the 7 individuals in the high AQ group demonstrated ambiguous use of third-person pronouns, which is characteristic of some individuals with Autism \cite{pronoun}. This includes using first names. This is particularly detrimental to search engine query strings because the use of names disrupts the term frequency - inverse document frequency weighting \cite{tfidf} of the search query and subsequently the results returned to the user.
}\label{pronoun}
 
\item{
For questions that were `social' in nature (e.g., featuring a face of a famous woman), 2 out of 7 individuals in the high AQ group indicated that these were types of queries that they would not normally be interested in, and so ``wouldn't bother asking it". For these queries, it was more common for individuals in the high AQ group to include information in their search query string that was extraneous to the search question itself, compared to the low AQ group. For example, in query 4 above (which asked respondents to indicate how they would identify a famous person), 2 high AQ scorers included information about the woman's earring. Inevitably this `dilutes' the search query and results in reduced precision for the search engine.
}

\begin{comment}
\item{ 
Lastly there were more spelling errors and typographical errors in the high AQ group compared to the low AQ group.
}\label{spelling}
\end{comment}



\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Transforming the User Query.}
Given the set of observations in the data reported above, the aims were to `transform' queries made by individuals in the high AQ group to queries more similar to the low AQ group. The search engines already handle some of the observations from high AQ scorer queries. For example, the use of pronouns ('I' and `You') is already taken care of with the use of stop words. The aim of the project is to therefore address issues that result in the search query string being misleading, and returning differnt results to low AQ scorer search queries. The rule engine is a concrete and operationalised framework, for a theoretically-grounded stereotyped user model of autism within search. \\

\vspace{5mm} %5mm vertical space
Jellibeans works to address multiple observations made during the data collection stage, so the order in which the observations are tackled in the user model is not linear. As a general rule, changes will take the form of `add on' questions that aim to structure the individuals search query logically, so that key search terms are not dropped. A structured query formation will assist the user with less idiosyncratic search queries. \\


\vspace{5mm} %5mm vertical space

Building upon the reserach discussed in the introduction \cite{seo}, that search can be compartmentatlised into three broad categories (Do's, Know's and Go's), and, to address the observation of idiosyncrasy (point \ref{idiosyncrasy} above in the current research), Jellibeans will prompt the user to categorise their search query into one of 3 possible types of queries, a `Do', `Know' or, `Go'. `Do' queries are when they want to do something on the web like, buy a cinema ticket. `Know' queries for when they want to know something from the web like, what time the cinema closes. And, `Go' queries when they want to go somewhere specific on the web like the cinema homepage. Jellibeans will integrate a fourth subtype of query -- the `Social' query, especially for the user group in question. `Social' queries are for when their search is about something social; a person, or group of people. Social queries have additional functionality beyond the Do, Know and Go query pages, to reflect the additional difficulties individuals with Autism have when formulating Social search queries on the web.

\vspace{5mm}
Each type of query will be associated with a different colour, and once the user has selected that type of query, this colour will be prominent on the page throughout their search, to serve as a visual reminder of the task. This works to reduce the \textbf{working memory load} for the user, and to serve as a \textbf{goal-directed cue}. Two things we know are difficult for people with Autism are maintenance of information in working memory, and goal-directed tasks involving a high demand on Executive Functioning (Executive functions (also known as cognitive control and supervisory attentional system) is an umbrella term for the management (regulation, control) of cognitive processes, including working memory, reasoning, task flexibility, and problem solving as well as planning and execution \cite{EF}.) 

\vspace{5mm} %5mm vertical space

The Jellibeans `Social' query applies particularly to the user group in question, and has hints and suggestions added into search to assist the user when forming their query. The cues take the form of suggestions, that the user may select if helpful for their search, and to improve search results that are returned from Jellibeans.

\vspace{5mm} %5mm vertical space
To address observation \ref{incomplete}, that user queries were often submitted when incomplete, suggestions as well as drop down menus have been implemented on each search page. Users can click on suggestions, and select from the menus if they want the keyword to be added to their search. Individuals with Autism have an uneven cognitive profile, where verbal ability is usually lower than performance skill \cite{DSM}, the cues will assist users who have particular word-finding difficulties.


\vspace{5mm}
Once the user has pressed `Jellibean Search', and requested their search results be returned, Jellibeans collates all information the user has entered into the search boxes, as well as any suggestions, and options from drop down menu's that were selected to be included in the search. To achieve a good precision and specificity, Jellibeans implemented `AND' boolean operators between each input of the parametric search. This resulted in increased precision and a drop in recall for Jellibeans. The results are then presented to the user, with the exact phrase that was searched for. This means that the user can clearly see their final search query, and rather than a `black-box' system, Jellibeans also works to train the user for the long-term about specific ways to improve their personal search query strings. 

 \vspace{5mm}
 Because the current research identified that user's with Autism formed search queries were particularly incomplete for socially-grounded informational needs, extra functionality has been added to the `Social' query page. For example, if the user has indicated that they are searching for a famous person, they will be prompted for descriptions about that famous person's personality, character age bracket, and physical descriptions amongst other attributes. These features work to ensure that for this type of query, where users with Autism have most difficulty, that user search queries are more complete than they otherwise would have been (see Figure~\ref{socialCompleted}).

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{SocialCompleted}
\caption{Example of User's Social Search in Jellibeans.}
\label{socialCompleted}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


\vspace{5mm} %5mm vertical space

The Autism Quotient score and all 50 of the responses from the user will be stored locally to an Excel file, if the user chooses, by selecting the `Save Your Answers' button on the Jellibean Homepage (see Figure~\ref{saveScores}).

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{saveScores}
\caption{Example of User's Social Search in Jellibeans.}
\label{saveScores}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The user can also choose `Calculate Your Score' which returns the score as an alert to the page

\vspace{5mm} %5mm vertical space
To further address Core Feature 3 of Jellibeans, that is, that results should be returned to the user in smaller snippets rather than large sets of text, I modified the Jellibeans Custom Search Engine to select the 3 highest ranked (precision) results, and to present these back to the user on the first page of their search. The 3 top results are presented on a floating modal\footnote{A modal is a feature in the Bootstrap Framework, for more information see Appendix~\ref{implementation}}, so that the user has the option to close and reopen the results very easily, without having to redo the search itself (see Figure~\ref{resultsModal}).


\subsection{Integration with a Motion Controlled Interface.}

The selection process for the hardware to integrate with Jellibeans considered 4 factors; the timing of the device, the `volume', the applicability to real-world environments and the affordability for users.

\vspace{5mm}
Jellibeans is integrated with the LEAP Motion Controller Hardware (see Figure~\ref{leap}) which has good timing as it polls frames at a constant rate to keep to timining of accurate movement, and this is important for user experience. It is very easy to use and only requires a short calibration period. It is non-invasive and has a low sensory experience (sensory stimulation is not tolerated well by individuals with Autism). The cognitive demand needed to operate the LEAP is low, and given that web search is a highly cognitive task, this is of real benefit for the user.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{leap}\\
\caption{The LEAP controller, with 150 degree view \cite{leap}.}
\label{leap}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The LEAP recognises and tracks hands, fingers, finger-like tools, positions, motions and gestures using infrared light and optical sensors along the cartesian coordinate system. The controller has a 150-degree field of view, and operates in a range of 1 inch to 2 feet.  

\vspace{5mm}
Each of our senses operates with a different lag time. Hearing has the fastest sense-to-cognition/understanding, and surprisingly, sight -- the slowest. If the device interferes with the processing of the sense, it will confuse the combinatorial configuration of the senses, leading to misunderstandings in the meaning and a worse user experience. The LEAP does not have the best cognitive lag time compared to other devices such as the Oculus VR Rift. However, for Jellibeans, the browser refresh rate will likely be the biggest bottleneck for performance, rather than the motion-controller chosen. The LEAP is a completely non-invasive in comparison to the Rift (see Figure~\ref{vrVsLEAP}), so it was considered a better option for the current user group.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{VRvsLEAP}
\caption{Comparison of the invasivness of the Oculus VR Rift and LEAP motion controller.}
\label{saveScores}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

I also took into consideration the way in which the device manifests actions into behaviours. That is, how does the user engage behaviourally within the environment using the device? The LEAP was considered very realistic in terms of the transition of behaviour into real-world environments.

\subsubsection{Using LEAP in the IDE.}
Frames (cartesian coordinate data) from the LEAP were traked using the \texttt{Frames} class, and detected user motions. The following code was used to implement a forward-poking pointing motion to control mouse clicks. I ran the code to check how well it worked in Eclipse IDE (see https://youtu.be/ikfiul\_JPBk for a video of the LEAP working in my IDE). 

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{leapCode}\\
\caption{Pointing and Poke Motion Used to Control Mouse Clicks.}
\label{leapCode}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.65]{Monty1}\\
\caption{Using the LEAP to Control the Cursor in the IDE. Console Output is Hand Coordinates along the x, y, and z Axes.}
\label{Monty}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Although using the device this way was interesting and novel, the user has unstable control over the cursor, and often hand movements aren't precise enough to have a good experience using the hardware. I decided to look for a library that I could use with the LEAP to overcome this. One such library is LeapStrap which I discuss in the next section.


\subsubsection{Using LeapStrap in the Web-browser.}
To use the LEAP in a web-browser I used LeapStrap \cite{leapstrap}, which is built on top of Bootrap and was easy to integrate into the project. To integrate LeapStrap into the HTML I added link in the LeapStrap CSS , jQuery, Leap.js and LeapStrap.js. I also initialised the Leap in the body of the HTML code, and finally made all elements of the class ``leap-interactive" (see Figure~\ref{leapstrap}). 

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.60]{leapstrap}
\caption{LeapStrap Library to Implement the LEAP for Jellibeans.}
\label{leapstrap}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Once the LEAP was enabled for the web browser I was able to test Jellibeans with users to gather feedback.

\end{figure}

\section{Testing and Critical Evaluation of Jellibeans}
\subsection{Testing and Evaluation of the Combined Search Engine.}
To test the integrated combined search engine, 10 participants took part in a study to evaluate the quality of it's output. The participants were selected because they scored highly (above 30, where 32 is threshold for Autism Spectrum Disorder with a 79\% sensitivity) on a 50-item screening measure of Autism-like tratis (the Autism Quotient \cite{Baron Cohen et al}), and these individuals were thought to be most suited to test the current system. 

\vspace{5mm}
The range of scores for the AQ is 0 to 50 with high scores indicating increased likelihood of autism-like traits. A score under 21 is a low to average result (many women average around 15 and men around 17). A score of 22-25 indicates autistic tendencies slightly above the population average. A score above 26 gives a borderline indication of high functioning autism, or Aspergers. A score above 30 suggests a likelihood of Aspergers syndrome or autism (sensitivity of test measure = 79\% \cite{Baron Cohen et al}). For the purposes of this study, individuals with scores equal to, and above 30 were interpreted as having `autistic-like traits'.

\vspace{5mm}
Participants were asked to comment on their search results from 10 (pre-determined) informational needs. Participants were also asked to choose three out of the links returned that they would choose to follow up with. They were also asked if anything was odd about the results returned. The responses from the 10 users were then analysed. 

\vspace{5mm}
Somewhat non-surprisingly (given the statistics of most preferred search engines (Google's unique monthly visitors: 1,100,000,000 and query
volume: 64.5\% ; Bing: 350,000,000, 12.8\%; and Yahoo!: 300,000,000, 64.5\% (\cite{ebiz} \cite{adam})), the results revealed Bing Search was favoured the least, and Google results the most, with Yahoo falling somewhere in between. Out of the 30 responses participants indicated to follow up with (3 per participant), 21 were Google results, 3 were Yahoo, and 1 was Bing and 5 results overlapped between Google and Yahoo. Four participants commented specifically, that the Bing results were distracting rather than helpful.

\vspace{5mm}
Given these findings from the user group, future iterations of Jellibeans will continue using the Google results, but drop the results from Yahoo and Bing, in line with the aim of the project as a whole, that is, to improve returned search results for users with Autism.

\subsection {Evaluation of the LEAP Motion Controller in Jellibeans.}
The LEAP motion controller is an impressive device that uses infra-red light to embed the users (phantom) hands onto the screen. It is a novel, `at home' technology, and because of the portable nature of the device, it is one that has been introduced to laptops. The LEAP offers a recalibration process if the controller is persistently jumpy, which is good because jumpy movements and mannerisms could be an issue for some of the users in the current user group. The device will recalibrate if there are discontinuities or aberrations in the tracking data in certain field of view, or in poor tracking ranges. 

\vspace{5mm}
The LEAP does however miss small hand movements, and also very large ones (outside of the 150 degree angle along the y axis (see Figure~\ref{leap})). The LEAP also neglects to track the bottom left and right-most corners of the screen. I have tried to take this into consideration when designing Jellibeans, so that the user does not need to reach to the corners of the screen.

\section{Software Testing}

I used Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) to test the integration of my HTML, CSS and JavaScript code. The testing process consisted of development, test, make modifications, test (and so on) until the behaviour of the website was what I intended.\\

\vspace{5mm}
The JavaScript Console was used for testing JavaScript code. \cite{javascripttesting}, I also used JSfiddle \cite{jsfiddle} to ensure the code contained no bugs, and was particularly good for seeing how the JavaScript code integrated with the HTML code and CSS.

\vspace{5mm}
JUnit was used to test the Combination Search Engine and the LEAP motion controller methods, which were written using Java. Unit testing was completed, at the method level.

\section{User Verification and User Testing}
Five high AQ scorers were called back from the previous research study for one-to-one interviews and a combined focus group. During the interview, individuals were given the same user search queries as previously, and for each search that was implemented, users were asked to comment on whether it enhanced, or took away from their search experience, and from their satisfaction with the search results. Users were asked to comment on:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Whether the colour coding for each category of search was helpful.}
\item{Whether they liked the parametric search style of Jellibeans}
\item{Whether they felt Jellibeans `narrowed' the scope for irrelevant detail.}
\item{If they would choose Jellibeans over other search engines, for example, Google, and why.}
\item{The speed and efficiency of search with Jellibeans}
\item{Their thought on search results.}
\item{The integration of Jellibeans with the LEAP motion controller.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The Positives}
All 5 users verified that the `Dashboard' colour coding was helpful (see Figure~\ref{colourCoding}), and liked that the colour of the chosen type of search remained on screen for its duration.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{DoKnowGoSocialDashboard}
\caption{Colour coding on Jellibean dashboard.}
\label{colourCoding}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The modals (floating window reminders) for each of the colour themes were useful for all new users, as they were originally unfamiliar with the colours. The associations for all user groups, including users with Autism, were quick to learn, these were single link visual (rather than verbal) associations.\\

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{floatingModals}
\caption{Modals Assist New Users To Lean the Colour Associations.}
\label{colourCoding}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


Four out of 5 participants agreed that one of the major positives of Jellibeans was that unlike Google, users did not receive back hundreds and thousands of mostly irrelevant results. Jellibeans held their interest for longer because of the reduced number of results that users had to sift through. Testing also revealed that the parametric search style meant that they did not need to try and remember all the key words to search for, rather the cues helped them remember points they would have missed otherwise. \\

\vspace{5mm}
A common comment (3 out of 5 users) was the time/reward payoff from completing a detailed search form. Users agreed that although they would spend more time formulating their search query, they were likely to save time that would usually be spent sifting through search results. These participants indicated that they would use Jellibeans over other search engines if continued use on other queries also showed such benefit.\\

\vspace{5mm}
All users positively commented on the reduced number of search results presented (top 3). The amount of textual information that was presented back on the results page is significantly reduced in Jellibeans. 

\vspace{5mm}
During the focus group one user with high functioning Autism described that the direct questions (e.g., `What do you want to do on the web?'), with suggestions (`Shop', `Watch', `Listen'), was useful when he was ``at a total blank". He disclosed that often his need for perfectionism and sameness could have him staring at a blank screen until he came up with the `perfect' query. However, the suggestions were helpful for him to get started, and so his experience was that the queries were completed faster than usual.  \\

\subsection{The Negatives}

Two users however, had considerations about the `missing' results from their search and commented that for them, 3 results were too few and perhaps 5 or 6 results would have been a better choice. It must be said that these individuals were amongst the lowest AQ scorers, suggesting that the amount of text individuals with Autism find optimal is a function of the severity of Autism traits in that individual.

\vspace{5mm}
One participant commented that the suggestions that appear on the sides of the `Do', `Know', `Go' and `Social' pages were not user-specific (see Figure~\ref{suggestions}). He suggested implementing something that is user-centred, user-driven, or, trending, rather than static.

\begin{figure}[H]

However, one of the characteristics of Autism is restricted and repetitive behaviours, and an aims of the current project was to reduce the restricted and repetitive nature of search queries for people with Autism. In other words, this comment was suggesting that Jellibeans was achieving the aim it had set out to do.

\vspace{5mm}
Nevertheless, one future direction for Jellibeans in order to achieve a balance between user-specific suggestions but not restricted interests, is to include a recommendation system that changes often enough for them not to be repetitive, but still within a range of possible interests for that individual. 

\subsection{Other observations}

Users agreed during the focus group that with Jellibeans the time/reward payoff is really only apparent, over and beyond a traditional search engine, when the search query is complex. For example, if users are searching for something they have yet to identify, i.e., something ambiguous. To overcome this criticism, Jellibeans includes a `Search in Google' option, so that if users know what they are searching for, they have the option to run the search outside Jellibeans.

\subsection{Quantifiable results}
The 5 participants were also asked to re-construct the same search queries they had been asked to construct in the first research study, but this time using Jellibeans. The search strings that these users would formulare without and then with Jellibeans are 5 participants are presented in Figure~\ref{results}.

\subsection{Signals of Quality Content}
I will test and evaluate the system. Testing will involve assessing the reliability and robustness of Jellibeans; the ease of its interaction; boundary conditions; ease of use; does it fulfil the aims of the project.
Evaluation of the system will include comparisons to existing search engines; assessing how this idea can be implemented to tailor an existing systems; assessing how well the system does compared to existing systems on a set of criteria that are only relevant to the user group in question (a collective measure of user happiness). Evaluation will also include quantitative metrics such as Recall, Precision, and False Negative/Positive rates.

\subsection{Future Directions}
A future direction for Jellibeans would be to use an API or library for word frequencies in the written English language, which could be integrated with a thesaurus. This type of API requires significant research into the natural language processing of written (rather than spoken) English text. These frequency data could have been used to replace infrequent words in queries formed by individuals with Autism with more frequent words to suggest alternatives for the user. Of course this product would not be scalable, and only apply to users with a particular dialect. This is because word frequency is considerably variable across, and even within a language (e.g., consider South-West England compared to the North of England).

\vspace{5mm}
Another future direction for Jellibeans would be to implement current trending searches, which could be a contributing factor in the future for why users choose other search engines over Jellibeans. 

\vspace{5mm}
Individuals with Autism have increased comorbidity with Attention Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and Colour Blindness, and so these can be taken into account for future iterations of Jellibeans. For example, the colours used for Jellibeans are in the RGB colour scheme, but these could be replaced with gradients or patterns so that individuals with colour blindness can also also benefit.

\subsection{Languages and APIs Used in Jellibean Implementation}\label{implementation}

\begin{tabular}{l p{11cm} }
Google Search API & A RESTful API with a single method called list. The API method used was GET, and the response data is returned as a JSON type. The response consists of (1) the actual search result, (2) metadata for search like number of results, alternative search queries, and (3) custom search engine metadata. Google terms of service, state that `screen scraping', or copying the data directly from the website is prohibited.\\
JSoup API & For Bing and Yahoo search results, JSoup (a Java HTML parser) was used to identify the links from the resulting query. The JSoup HTML parser was considered more efficient for retrieving search results, as it could be used to complete the task from both search engines, using a slightly different href element filter for each. JSoup also has advantages over html parsing. It contains a class representing a list of nodes called `Elements', which implements Iterable to iterate over a list in an enhanced for loop.\\
Java & To test the combined output from the three search engines with a group of users, and gather their feedback on the results, I developed a Java Applet to run the programme. The search results from the Java Applet were written to a text file. Java was chosen for development of `to be tested' packages of features (e.g., the combination search engine). The developer for the project was most proficient with Java, and could quickly develop prototypes for user testing.\\
JavaScript & JavaScript is commonly used in HTML as it can run locally in a browser (rather than remote server). The Google+ API provided good documentation for using JavaScript. Furthermore the JavaScript code could be easily embedded into the Jellibean HTML code to interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) of the page. The browser was able to respond to user demand quickly, which made Jellibeans more responsive. JavaScript was used in this way to return the aboutMe profile information from Google+ to the user.\\
HTTP Set-Up & The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) enables communications between web-browsers (clients) and the server (the computer that hosts Jellibeans) using a request-response protocol. Jellibeans was deployed in textbf{nginx} HTTP web server, and digitalocean.com was used to host the web servers, so that it was ready to be used remotely by users (and for me to gather feedback easily). When the user submits a HTTP request to the server that hosts Jellibeans, it responds with the appropriate behaviour to the client so that the user can formulate their search query and retrieve the results from their search. \\
JQuery & \\
php & \\

\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{l p{11cm} }
HTML & HyperText Markup Language (HTML 5) was used to create the webpages for Jellibeans, so that the web browser could render the wesite.\\
Bootstrap and CSS & For front-end development and to style the Jellibean web pages I used the Bootstrap framework \cite{bootstrap} for it's clear styles, good design and ease of use for the current project. I included my own Cascading Style Sheet (css file) where I needed extra styling beyond what the Bootstrap framework could offer. \\
LEAP SDK & The LEAP motion controller is a light-weight, portable device that detects user motions using infra-red light. The LEAP has accurate timing, and works well with the combinatorial configuration of senses (sight, hearing and touch). As this is a tool to be used with individuals with Autism, who have increased sensitivity to touch, the LEAP is the perfect choice as there is no additional sensations to the users body. The LEAP is affordable for users to integrate with search at home, and currently retails for about \pounds60.\\
LeapStrap & The LeapStrap SDK was used to integrate the LEAP into the web broswer. LeapStrap is a HTML5 front-end framework for websites, and gives them fill LEAP motion functionality. \\
